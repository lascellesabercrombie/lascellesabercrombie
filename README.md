### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Alex (he/him), a developer with an interest in accessible, efficient and multilingual design. I'm not to be confused with Lascelles Abercrombie, minor poet and theorist of the early twentieth century, whose name I used for this account. I'm currently working on [a front-end web app for practising writing Chinese characters](https://github.com/lascellesabercrombie/hanzi-game).
