### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Alex (he/him), studying web development with [__Founders and Coders__](https://github.com/foundersandcoders)! 

I'm currently working on various projects as part of FAC's course, using mostly HTML, CSS and JS. 

I'm interested in accessible and multilingual design. 

I'm not to be confused with Lascelles Abercrombie, minor poet and theorist of the early twentieth century, whose name I used for this account.
