### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Alex (he/him), studying web development with [__Founders and Coders__](https://github.com/foundersandcoders)! 

### About Me

- I'm currently working on workshops and challenges as part of FAC's pre-apprenticeship course, using mostly HTML, CSS and JS. 

- I'm interested in accessible and multilingual design. 

- I'm not to be confused with Lascelles Abercrombie, minor poet and theorist of the early twentieth century, whose name I used for this account. 

### What I'm Learning

- The bulk of my work at the moment is on JavaScript.

- Recent topics of study include asynchronous functions, HTTP requests, and how to use TDD to work towards the solutions of complex problems.

- In addition to the FAC course, I have been supporting my learning using exercises in Execute Program, freeCodeCamp and Codecademy.

### What I'm Working On

 - **Note-Taking App ([repo](https://github.com/lascellesabercrombie/fac-workshop-tdd-array-methods) | deployment)**
    - collaboration with [George](https://github.com/glombort)
    - a fully tested app that allows the user to add, check, delete and filter their notes
    - status: just begun
    
 - **Home Traveller ([repo](https://github.com/alternadiva/Home-Traveller-Project) | [deployment](https://alternadiva.github.io/Home-Traveller-Project/))**
    - collaboration with [Petra](https://github.com/alternadiva) and [Sonia](https://github.com/sonianb)
    - an app that allows the user to generate a recipe and film on the basis of a chosen or randomly selected country
    - uses 3 APIs to dynamically create content for the user
    - takeaway: invaluable training in asynchronous JS and calling APIs, especially the process of converting the results from one API call so that they can be used in the call to another API
    - status: in working order
    
 - **Agency Website ([repo](https://github.com/lascellesabercrombie/agency-website) | [deployment](https://lascellesabercrombie.github.io/agency-website/))**
    - collaboration with [Petra](https://github.com/alternadiva)
    - a single-page website for the fictional agency Flag to Flag
    - uses HTML and CSS with a focus on HTML forms
    - takeaway: good training in CSS grids and thinking about mobile-first design
    - status: in working order
    
 - **SquareGame ([repo](https://github.com/lascellesabercrombie/SquareGame) | [deployment](https://lascellesabercrombie.github.io/SquareGame/))**
    - collaboration with [Minju](https://github.com/kmj673)
    - a thrilling game in which you (a Pokemon) evade your natural enemy (the Pokeball)
    - coded in a mixture of HTML, CSS and JS
    - status: in progress
    
 - **FAC Application Website ([repo](https://github.com/lascellesabercrombie/fac-application-website) | [deployment](https://lascellesabercrombie.github.io/fac-application-website/))**
    - a single-page website created as part of the FAC application requirements
    - includes a project gallery of different tasks required for the application
    - includes a JS feature: a button that changes the content and layout of the page as the user toggles between English and Yiddish versions of the page
    - takeaway: really fun experimenting with what designing for a right-to-left language might mean 
    - status: in working order
