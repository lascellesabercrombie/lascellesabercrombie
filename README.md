### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Alex (he/him), an apprentice software developer at [__Lyfta__](https://github.com/lyfta) and recent graduate from [__Founders and Coders__](https://github.com/foundersandcoders)! 

### About Me

- I am currently enjoying getting to know Lyfta, its team and its codebase

- I'm interested in accessible and multilingual design. 

- I'm not to be confused with Lascelles Abercrombie, minor poet and theorist of the early twentieth century, whose name I used for this account.
