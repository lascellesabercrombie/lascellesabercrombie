### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Alex (he/him), studying web development with [__Founders and Coders__](https://github.com/foundersandcoders)! 

### About Me

- I'm currently working on various projects as part of FAC's course, using mostly HTML, CSS and JS. 

- I'm interested in accessible and multilingual design. 

- I'm not to be confused with Lascelles Abercrombie, minor poet and theorist of the early twentieth century, whose name I used for this account.
